# The Pasayten Institute
#### Our mission is to build and share physics knowledge, without barriers!
Finding the best way to do that has been something of a journey. More on that later.

#### Our Work So Far
* YouTube videos on Particle Physics, Operator Algebras and More
* A podcast where we share physics teaching and learning tips and tricks
* A weekly newsletter that shares stargazing tips and news from the world of physics
* A blog where were also share what we've found and have been working on.

#### What we're looking building here
* A space for our lecture notes
* A repository of easy to learn, physics demonstration code and visualizations

#### Please stay tuned!
